I am a software developer with experience in *Full Stack* Development, and recently graduated with a BSc in Math and CS.

I have professional experience building features for the web app of a B2B company, and in automating testing of firmware for a B2C company.

In my Joint Major in Math and Computer Science at SFU, I studied the fundamentals of CS and took further studies in Security, Databases, Systems, Graphics and Optimization.

## My projects

### mySoundJourney

A React Single Page Application I made to visualize the numbers behind the music I listen to on Spotify, for use by anyone with an account.

You can look at the energy, positivity and danceability of recently listened to music or your playlists. My design focuses on privacy first, which was enabled by using React and a client-side OAuth authentication flow that only communicates between your browser and Spotify's servers.

Check out the [source code](https://github.com/sanjayalwani/mySoundJourney), the site will be live soon after some updates.

### NonoGame

A [nonogram](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram) game built with plain old javascript.

### Pedestrian crossing simulator

A cellular automata simulation model for a pedestrian crossing at a two lane road, written in MATLAB.

This model was used to run multiple experiments, to investigate the effect of various parameters on pedestrian and vehicle wait times and other metrics.

Below you can see how changes to the Vehicle Arrival Period (VAP), Pedestrian Arrival Period (PAP) and Pedestrian Waiting Time (PWT), all measured in seconds, affect the percentage of stagnant vehicles in the road.

### CLI Wordle

Wordle in your CLI, written in C++.

Source code and execution instructions are in [this repository](https://github.com/sanjayalwani/cli_wordle).
